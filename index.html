<p class="SubSection">Sample Work: Trendcompass</p>
    <p class="BodyText Justified">
        In the following you can have a first look at my own creation of the Trendcompass, which I have first seen at the website of <a href="https://www.hsbc-zertifikate.de/home/trendkompass.html#!/">HSBC</a>
        With this Trendcompass you have the ability to analyze financial stock data from the past and thus discover possible price trends in the stock market.
        The interactive Chart clearly shows the relative strength according to Levy and the momentum of S&P 500 shares. The Interactivtiy of the Chart, thus zooming in and out, as well as draging the chart to different positions is possible due to the Usage of the <a href="https://altair-viz.github.io/index.html">Vega-Altair</a> Module in Python.
        Please take into strong account that the past performance of an underlying base value is not a reliable indicator of future performance. The Purpose of this Implementation is mainly to showcase my expertise in working with Data and my Interest in the Financial Industry.
    </p>

<p class="SubSection">How the Trendcompass works</p>
    <p class="BodyText Justified">
        In Levy's relative strength concept, the current closing price of the underlying is set in relation to the average of the closing prices of the last 27 weeks. This is a long-term, trend-following approach.
        A relative strength value greater than 1 means that the current closing price of an underlying base calue is above the average price of the last 27 weeks, which could indicate an upward stock trend.
        Conversely, values smaller than 1 indicate a below-average development within the last 27 weeks.

    </p>

    <p class="BodyText Justified">
        Momentum, on the other hand, puts the current closing price in relation to just one past price - in this case, the closing price four weeks ago. 
        A coefficient greater than 1 indicates that the current price of the respective underlying is higher than 4 weeks ago, which could indicate an upward trend. Similar to Levy's relative strength, values smaller than 1 indicate a negative price development of the underlying base value within the period under consideration. 
    </p>

    <p class="BodyText Justified">
        According to this concept, the upper right quadrant contains the stocks for which positive price developments can be identified both according to the long-term concept of relative strength according to Levy and measured by the shorter-term momentum.

        Stable trends are advantageous for both methods. If, on the other hand, a certain degree of trend continuity is lacking or if there are rapid trend changes, this impairs the informative value of the two concepts.

        The trend compass initially represents a snapshot, i.e. the values displayed reflect the situation at a fixed point in time - The Chart on my website is updated every Monday Morning (CEST)
